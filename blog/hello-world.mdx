Welcome to my blog! This is where I will write on various topics, primarily science and technology.

I'll commemorate this moment with a poem:

<Scroll>
<RunescapeFontQuill>
    *In the law of the land, there sits a decree,*  
    *That every new programmer's eyes must both see.*

    *For their first two words shall all be the same,*   
    *No matter their language, origin or name.*

    *Two words that told every one from near and wide,*  
    *that there was news to be shared about a new pride.*

    *As they show on the screen in all of their glory,*  
    *the coder can say they have started their story:*

    `Hello World`
</RunescapeFontQuill>
